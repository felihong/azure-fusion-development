## Power Apps and APIM
In this exercise, you will be using the Consoto health care API with Azure API management instance that you created in [part three](/architecture/) of this lab.


Star Wars API with Azure API Management instance that you created in part three of this lab. The Excel worksheet of member profiles will serve as the primary backing data source and will be used to generate a base application. You will export the Star Wars API from Azure API Management as a Power Platform Custom Connector so that the Canvas App can access real-time Star Wars character information. For each of the Fan Club members, you can then search the Star Wars API character data and show information about their favorite character in the Canvas App.
